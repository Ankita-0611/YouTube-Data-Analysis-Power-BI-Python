UC6WzPg6yxF9dQx2_O6R4lww,Nitish Rajput,"Nitish Rajput firmly believes that there are adequate tools available online through which people can be brought together, informed, and educated collectively. 

Social media and the Internet have the power to create any narrative, but this channel will use them to curate a healthy and informative narrative that genuinely benefits people in forming an opinion backed by facts and uncompromised information. 

Nitish Rajput wants to empower and facilitate people to challenge atrocities and become more vocal about the issues plaguing Indian society.",@nitishrajput,2020-04-29T17:18:25.574824Z,434189122,4710000,103
