Today's video delves into the mysterious world of exorcism and possession of demons. Is it a spiritual possession or a psychological condition?

Additionally, we discuss Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder, examining its causes, symptoms, and societal impact.

Today, we're unraveling the cultivated political narrative surrounding Narendra Modi, India's Prime Minister, often depicted as a self-made individual who began his journey by selling tea at a railway station. This portrayal, heavily amplified by channels like WhatsApp University, which often blur lines between fact and propaganda, is a cornerstone of Modi's public image. However, doubts and inconsistencies in these accounts have surfaced, raising questions about their veracity. We delve into how these narratives, whether embellished or partially fabricated, have been strategically employed to shape Modi's persona, appealing to the common man while potentially obscuring the complexities of his ascent to power and governance. Join us as we explore the layers behind Modi's carefully constructed public image, revealing the nuanced interplay between politics, perception, and digital manipulation.

Today, we're diving into a concerning issue affecting Indian spices exported worldwide. Last year, several spices sold in the USA were contaminated with salmonella, a bacteria known to cause serious food poisoning. But that's not all—Singapore and Hong Kong recently discovered that many Indian spices contain ethylene oxide, a cancer-linked chemical banned in numerous countries. This alarming trend isn't just about spices; over the past four years, Europe has banned or recalled over 500 Indian products due to harmful chemical content. Stick around as we unpack the implications of these findings and what it means for the safety standards of Indian food products on the global stage.

In today's video, we delve into the escalating epidemic of myopia, a condition affecting vision clarity, that has seen a dramatic rise in rates from 4.5% to over 21% among individuals aged 5-15 years in India over the past two decades. We explore the common misconception that near-sightedness is solely due to genetics or growth factors, revealing the significant role our environment and lifestyle choices play in this widespread issue. With predictions suggesting that by 2050, half the world's population could be near-sighted, we investigate the true causes behind this surge, discuss preventative measures, and finally address the age-old warning from our parents about watching too much TV. Join us as we uncover the truth about myopia, its implications, and what we can do to combat this growing epidemic.

After Japan's surrender in World War 2, Bose planned a secretive journey to the USSR, departing from Bangkok. Facing logistical challenges in war-torn Asia, his route included a complex flight plan with various stops. Tragically, the plane carrying Bose reportedly crashed in Taiwan. While some accounts state Bose perished in this crash, engulfed in flames, others suggest he survived and lived in hiding. The video explores various theories about his fate, including speculation that he was held captive in the USSR or lived incognito in India as 'Gumnami Baba'. This enduring mystery about Bose's death continues to fascinate and provoke debate, with numerous investigations and theories attempting to uncover the truth.

In this video, we delve into the harrowing Uttarkashi Tunnel Disaster that struck on November 12, amidst Diwali celebrations. A catastrophic collapse at an under-construction tunnel in Uttarakhand trapped 41 workers, sparking a desperate, multinational rescue mission. Miraculously, after 17 days, the workers were saved, thanks to the relentless efforts of over 200 people. This disaster highlights the precarious state of the Himalayas, already shaken by the earlier Joshimath sinking. We examine the controversial Char Dham highway project at the heart of these calamities, a massive undertaking aimed at connecting holy sites but criticized for its ecological impact. The documentary sheds light on the government's handling of the project, the risks of tunnel construction in the fragile Himalayan region, and the broader implications of such development projects. Join us as we explore the fine line between natural and man-made disasters and the lessons to be learned from the Uttarkashi rescue operation.

We analyze the concluding chapters of the original text, highlighting how they describe a ""happily ever after"" scenario in Ram Rajya, which seems inconsistent with the subsequent events in Uttarakand. This provides a strong argument against the inclusion of Uttarakand in the original scripture. Furthermore, the video discusses how the sacred name of ""Jai Shree Ram"" is being misused today by certain extremist elements to incite violence and hatred. We draw parallels between the misuse of religious chants in various faiths and call for a peaceful reclamation of the name of Lord Ram from those who tarnish it. Join Dhruv Rathee in a thought-provoking exploration of ancient scripture and its relevance in the context of today's world.

oZIlIludZto,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w,Why British Left India? | Reality of Mahatma Gandhi's Role | Quit India Movement | Dhruv Rathee,"On August 8, 1942, Mahatma Gandhi and the All India Congress Committee gathered at Gowalia Tank Maidan in Mumbai. They came together to advance the fight for independence and find a way to unite the people in this struggle. In his historic speech, Gandhi Ji delivered a simple yet powerful mantra: ""Do or Die.” This marked the beginning of the Quit India Movement, a movement that didn't rely on prominent leaders but inspired people to join the fight for freedom. The British authorities, sensing the growing resistance, arrested many leaders, including Gandhi Ji. However, the movement continued to gain momentum, and its impact was so significant that it became one of the most serious rebellions against British rule. In this video, we will explore the inspiring story of how our ancestors united to fight for India's independence during the Quit India Movement, despite facing challenges and arrests. Join Dhruv Rathee in this video to learn more about this remarkable chapter in our history.

ffRfIfGgjmw,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w,Israel Palestine War | What is Happening? |  Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"On October 7th, a significant escalation occurred between Israel and Palestine. Hamas launched thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel, leading to casualties on both sides. Israel retaliated with 'Operation Iron Swords', targeting Hamas assets in Gaza. The international community, including India, the US, the EU, and others, have expressed their concerns and stands on the issue. A major point of discussion is the failure of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, to predict such an attack. While the Palestinian cause has historical roots and deserves attention, the use of terrorism is condemned. It's essential to remember our shared humanity and hope for a peaceful resolution, envisioning a united Israel-Palestine with liberty and equality for all. Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee to understand what is happening in simple words!

A few days ago, when I posted a video on Kerala Story, I got immense support from you all. While I appreciate that, the video also got a lot of hate from some people who believe in spreading fake agendas. In fact, some people went ahead and started giving me threats just because I exposed their propaganda. In this video, I want to reply to all those baseless criticisms and also talk about how a few YouTubers like Elvish Yadav are misleading the people of our country.

Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee to find out, as he deep dives and explains the entire theory of evolution.

So, in this video, Dhruv Rathee outlines what whaling is, its history, and why it's wrong.

Aamir Khan's 3 idiots was a superhit movie back then in 2009. We all loved it, but it seems that the message is still not implemented. Because even today in 2022, the pressure on students to pursue stereotypical degrees like engineering, doctor, etc. is real. A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this? Why do we have such strong stereotypes? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee as he explains the root cause of this unfortunate problem that continues to exist in our society for decades - the education system.

RPiXj1t4wRQ,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w,"The Science of Ghosts | Paranormal, Bhoots and Ouija Boards Exposed | Dhruv Rathee","""Do ghosts really exist?"" is probably one of the most debatable questions in this world. While there is a section of people who believe that they do, there is another section who says that all this is just a psychological drama - and this makes the question even more interesting. If ghosts don't exist, what about the experiences of people who actually claim that they've seen ghosts? What about the footage where we have seen ghosts actually shouting? And what about things like the much popular Ouija Board and paranormal experiences that people claim? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee to find out the answer to all these questions.

People are not even allowed to cry out loud and take bodies to cremation if someone dies during this period. These rules might sound weird and funny to us, but this is a serious concern as the citizens of North Korea are brainwashed to the extent that they do not even know what's right and what's wrong. Watch this video where I explain these rules and why they are a problem in the 21st century.

This was a modern Russian made Mi-17V5 model of helicopter which was going from Sunur to Wellington. It is used for advanced operations and also for professional use by Indian prime minister and the Indian president. Many people came up with theories on why this crash might have happened? Was it the bad machinery, pilot error or bad weather? In this video, I explain these theories and conclude which is the most likely one by comparing this with the famous basketball player Kobe Bryant helicopter crash of 2020.

Recently, Twitter made an announcement that their new CEO will be Parag Agarwal. He is an Indian-American, i.e. an American with Indian roots. Parag was born in Ajmer (Rajasthan), he is an alumnus of IIT Bombay. So the news was bound to gather the attention of Indians. Some people congratulated him and expressed happiness, while others said that this is nothing in it to celebrate. It also reignited the topic of brain drain. In this video, I explain the concept of Brain Drain and why it doesn’t make much sense.

Kunal Kamra's Bengaluru shows were also cancelled. In a third separate incident, famous YouTuber Carryminati (Ajey Nagar) had to clip a portion of his MeTube video which showed Ramayan characters. The accusations of Anti-Hinduness are growing every day. I explain and analyse this situation and compare it with Akshay Kumar's film and YouTuber Elvish Yadav. In this video, we will see how the whole Hinduphobia drama is simply a political gimmick.

The election results are out and Mr. Narendra Modi is going to be India’s Prime Minister for a third consecutive term. He’s the only PM after Jawaharlal Nehru to do so. As you know, I followed the developments closely and as a citizen, there are certain things I expect of my Prime Minister. So, this video is an open letter to the PM from a citizen where I discuss the things that India needs from him in the next five years, and the things India doesn’t.

There are two main issues with this episode: how the rich find their way around the legal system and the blatant lack of road safety in India. This is what we will address in this video.

From Mumbai to Delhi, our urban environments are failing us. Join me as I explore why our cities are in such a dire condition and what we can do to demand better living conditions. Why does your city suck, and what are you willing to do about it?

In March this year, FIITJEE, one of the nation's most reputed  coaching institute published a full page controversial ad in the country's leading newspapers. The ad revealed the name and picture of an ex-FIITJEE student who couldn't hit a perfect score. But FIITJEE is not the only coaching institute that resorts to such ugly tactics. In this video we talk about the hypocrisy of Indian coaching institutes, why they still stay relevant and what's the work culture like in these institutes.

Last week, shocking news emerged from Karnataka's Hassan constituency as over 2,900 sex videos, allegedly recorded by MP Prajwal Revanna, surfaced on pen drives. Prajwal, a JD(S) leader from a prominent political family, is the joint BJP-JD(S) candidate for the recent Lok Sabha elections. The scandal has ignited a political firestorm, with accusations flying between Congress and BJP.  But this is not a one time occurence. Last year, a report found that there were as many as 134 MPs and MLAs across India who were implicated in cases involving crimes against women. Why is it that the political parties harp so much about women safety and yet so many of such accused candidates are in power? Do parties care less about women safety and more about political power? This is what we discuss in this video.

Across India, Narendra Modi remains a popular figure, captivating many voters. From Maharashtra's farmers who know Modi's name but not his party, to Uttar Pradesh's elderly struggling with government bureaucracy, and a Mumbai security guard barely making ends meet, the support for Modi is strong and widespread. But why does Modi continue to hold such an appeal? The reasons are complex and go beyond simple political loyalty. They include his strategic marketing, centralization of welfare schemes, and ability to connect with nationalist sentiments, creating a Cult Personality for Modi. But how have these strategies really helped PM Modi garner so much support, and is this personality cult beneficial to India? That's what we shall find out in this video.

Three major brands have recently found themselves in controversy over the products they have been selling. A report found that Nestle has been adding sugar to its products for babies - and following a double standard because no sugar was found in the same products sold in Western countries like the UK. On the other hand, Hong Kong and Singapore have withdrawn spices from two Indian brands- MDH and EVEREST - because a pesticide called ethylene oxide was found in them. Why are these companies able to do things like this? More importantly, why are the Indian food regulatory authorities not able to spot this? Also, why do customers fall into the trap of buying such products? This video tries to answer these pressing questions.

****** 

On 10th April 2024, the SC shouted at the Uttarakhand government authorities, ""We will rip you apart"", for their lack of action against Patanjali when it produced misleading ads for the consumers. Some people were happy that the Govt and Patanjali were finally being shown their place for how its ads fooled Indians. But others like Arnab Goswami immediately asked why the SC is shouting at Patanjali so much and not other FMCG brands like Pepsi, who also show misleading ads. What those people don't realise is that of course we should also criticise every company. However, the strictest punishment should be reserved for those who, during India's toughest medical crisis where, claim that their Ayurvedic medicine can cure people from COVID-19. This is a detailed video about how our government and media supported Patanjali's Coronil when India needed the most scientific solutions.

There is a new drug in town: Option and derivative trading! India is the biggest options market in the world! India accounted for a staggering 78% of equity options contracts traded worldwide in 2023. Yes, 78%! But you know that out of ten, nine people who make a loss in derivates can make any profit. This is why many people speculate that there is an option trading bubble in India and people are losing lakhs and crores of their money in future options trading.

Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi CM, has been arrested. ED has called him the ""kingpin & key conspirator"""" of the liquor scam. This is a HUGE deal. Arvind Kejriwal has become the first sitting CM to be arrested in Independent India. Jayalalitha and Heman Sroren have also been arrested, but both were no longer CMs when they were arrested. Many people are discussing the arrest, but no one seems to be discussing the case. I will do this to understand why the ED arrested Arvind Kejriwal and whether they were right? This is a detailed video on Delhi's liquor scam.

90 billion dollars! That is the net worth of Adani today. According to reports, there has been a remarkable growth in Adani’s wealth in the past 10 years. But did Adani’s growth start just 10 years ago? How did this guy from Gujarat expand his empire meteorically in a country that is dominated by family-owned business dynasties? And is his growth good for India? This is what we’ll discuss in the video. We talk about Adani’s childhood, his businesses, his relationship with governments, and of course, the controversies that surround this Gujarati man.","India,rahul gandhi,tempo,trucks,modi,modi news,elections 2024,lok sabha elections,gautam adani,congress,bjp,aaj tak news,india today news,khan sir",2024-02-02T12:26:56Z,PT28M13S,1426322,42308,0,1926

Astrotalk, an astrology startup swimming in a sea of failed ventures, somehow stays afloat. Offering free horoscopes and relationship pondering, it lures users into paid one-on-one sessions, live chats, and an ""Astromall"". Its success taps into India's digital natives seeking cosmic guidance amid uncertainties. While critics frown upon its therapy-esque approach, Astrotalk manages to ride the cosmic wave. But even in such a tough economic environment, how is this startup minting crores of profit? That's what this video is about.

But are actors' high fees the REAL problem? From remakes and poorly-written scripts to disastrous VFX, this video uncovers shocking realities behind your favourite blockbusters and also those big-budgeted movies that brought about a much bigger disappointment.

Punjab has been handled, or more like mishandled by many governments until today. 
Once India's second-richest state during the Green Revolution, today Punjab has become a current debt-ridden one. But how did it get here?
In this video we unfold the intricate details of Punjab's financial woes, its overdependence on subsidies, and how political decisions have contributed to the state's fiscal challenges. With insights into the recent actions taken by the AAP government, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the state's economic situation and its uncertain future. But the question is, will Punjab be able to ever reclaim its former glory?

In India, there is a widespread perception that everyone is pursuing engineering or medicine. However, a recent study by the Ministry of Education revealed that the most sought-after course is not engineering or medicine but rather Bachelor of Arts (BA). Despite its popularity, BA courses in India face numerous challenges related to employability, the quality of education, and even discrimination from families and employers. In this video, we aim to address the contradiction between the popularity of the BA course and its subpar quality.",India,2023-11-03T12:08:28Z,PT21M9S,1459011,63624,0,5044

Breaking News! PM Modi's ""Revdi Revolution!""
PM Modi, known for criticizing Congress's ""Revdi culture,"" just pulled a delightful twist when, as a Rakhi gift, he slashed the LPG prices by INR 200! While some hail this move as the epitome of his pro-poor stance, the opposition disagrees. The opposition says that the sudden generosity is because PM Modi fears the ""I.N.D.I.A alliance"". And that the BJP still has 2004 election nightmares! So, they're serving up ""revdis"" to woo voters. So, what is the truth? Why is the BJP offering the subsidy now when it has criticized this behavior time and again? That's what we shall find out in this video.

Are we alone in this universe? 
This is a question that has haunted many of us- scientists and common people alike. There are debates and even sinister conspiracy theories. 
But what does science say? 
In this video, we delve into what it takes for planets to develop life and whether we will ever be able to make contact with aliens (If they exist).

Lights, camera, and an expanding concern! Why are Indian women tipping the scales more than men?  In this video, we debunk myths, explore culture's role, and unveil the secrets behind those numbers. This video also sheds light on the harsh consequences that not many talk of. We rewind the scenes, interview the experts, and paint a picture beyond the scale with some interesting stories from three women to answer one important question ""Why are Indian women fatter than men?""

Description: The death of a first-year student from Jadavpur University (JU), allegedly subjected to extreme ragging by seniors in the main university hostel, has brought to the forefront the problem of ragging again. Despite being banned, ragging continues to persist across numerous colleges in India. Why is that? In this video, we discuss this issue while also touching upon the origins and psychology behind why seniors rag juniors and what are the consequences of this practice.

On May 18th, 1974, India did something that sent ripples all over the world- we conducted our first nuclear test. This decision was not an easy one- there was a lot of build-up, debates and discussions leading up to this moment. After the test was conducted, India displayed to the world that it too was capable of using nuclear energy. There was one man who needs to be credited greatly for this achievement: Dr. Homi Jehangir Bhabha. A young boy who had set out to study engineering at the University of Cambridge went on to develop India's nuclear program! How did that happen? In this video, we retrace the story that led India to become a nuclear power in the world today.

Kerala has been in the news this year- mostly because of the Kerala story. Based on this movie, Kerala was subject to a lot of criticism. Some said that Kerala is poised to become an Islamic state and something needs to be done about it. Yet there are people who maintain that Kerala is different from other states - That Kerala is truly the most ""secular"" state in India. So, what is the real Kerala story? 
In this video, we dive into the history of Kerala and the relationship between the communities that exist there. We take a look at the local customs, traditions, and festivals and try to analyze how Kerala has been different from the other states, particularly in the north of India- when it comes to communal harmony. 
But, that being said, Kerala is not totally free from communal violence- there have been cases of communal violence here as well. We take a look at what’s changing in the state and what could possibly be the reason behind this

Virginity is a big deal in India. Despite so much exposure to social media and openness to talk about topics relating to sexual issues, a lot of Indians want to marry only virgins. 
Pandering to conservative India's continuing preference for  virgins, a lot of Indian girls are going under the knife for hymen reconstruction surgeries (called hymenoplasty) 
There are even pills and artificial hymen being sold online that ""help"" women appear to be virgins again. 
In this video, we explore the reasons behind this- why do women have to resort to such measures? What's behind this obsession with virginity in India?

Manipur has been burning. The violence has claimed several innocent lives and wreaked havoc in this Northeastern state. A recent video of two women who were sexually molested and paraded naked has raised questions about the failure of the twin-engine BJP government. In our previous video on Manipur, we explored the cause of the violence. But it's been more than 80 days now, and the fire is still ablaze. Who is to be blamed for this and the numerous lives that suffered? Let's find out in this video.

Earlier this year, GoFirst, an Indian airline, filed for bankruptcy and suspended its operations. However, this is merely the most recent addition to a growing list of failing and failed airlines in India. In fact, over the past decade, a total of 13 companies, including prominent airline companies such as Kingfisher, Air Deccan, and Jet Airways, have ceased operations. Consequently, the question arises as to why so many airlines fail in India.

India has launched the Chandrayaan 3 and the Western nations have all been applauding India for its tremendous achievements in space exploration. But this was not the case back in 1947. When India had become a free country, we were plagued by a plethora of problems- hunger, poverty, and the humungous task of running a nation. In that scenario, thinking of a space program was too ambitious. Even when ISRO was established, the West expressed its doubts over how successful we'd be. But we've beaten all the odds- today, India is set to transform the space and we have a new player on the horizon- the private sector. India has become home to several startups that are attracting investors like Google! In this video, we go through the space journey of India and also discuss what private players have to offer in the field of space.

When certain chapters on the Mughal dynasty were removed by the government, a lot of people on social media celebrated the move by saying that Mughals were often associated with violence and the destruction of religious sites. So, it would be right to not teach the children about such Kings. But did you know that in  India's history, there were several kings who have made similar use of violence? Even glorified kings like Ashoka and Akbar have been known to use violence!
What drove these kings to exercise violence? What were the reasons behind their decision? But more importantly, so many Kings throughout history have made use of violence, what standards should be used to describe them? Watch the video to get answers!

The idea of an undivided India or an Akhand Bharat has been in people’s minds for a long time now. This sentiment, particularly prominent among right-wing factions, has fueled a fervent demand for the realization of Akhand Bharat. Now with an RSS backed government in power, is an Akhand Bharat really possible?

On June 23rd, a group of soldiers representing the Wagner group rebelled against the Russian military. The private military group’s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said it was a march against Russian military leadership. Just when it seemed that the rebellion could push Russia into an internal armed conflict, Prigozhin suddenly announced that his group was withdrawing from the rebellion. It appeared that Putin had struck a deal with Prigozhin to end the rebellion. What was this bizarre sequence of events? How did a supposed “coup” begin and finish within 24 hours? Who even is Prigozhin and the Wagner group? What impact would the rebellion have on the Ukraine-Russia war, but perhaps more importantly, what could it mean for Putin’s future and his relationship with global powers, including India? These are the things we address in this video.

India has recently become the most populous country in the world. This means that one thing that we have enough of is population. But despite this, the state government of Sikkim is providing incentives to the people in its state- to encourage them to have more babies. Why is that? This is because the Total fertility rate of Sikkim has fallen to 1.1 which means that on average, a woman in Sikkim is giving birth to only one baby in her reproductive lifespan. This has got the government really worried because a TFR of at least 2.1 is necessary to replace the population at its existing level. A TFR of 1.1 would mean that if things continue the way they are right now, the population of Sikkimese people will be in danger. How dangerous this exactly is and what is the government doing to address that? This is what we will be talking about in this video

On 2 June 2023, tragedy struck when three trains collided near Balasore, Odisha. Two passenger trains, the Coromandel Express and the SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah SF Express, collided after an initial collision involving goods train near Bahanaga Bazar station. At least 275 people were killed and more than a thousand people were injured. In this video, we examine what happened in Odisha, and why it happened. We also discuss the indigenous Kavach system as well as assess the IR, CAG, and NCRB reports to understand what's really wrong with the Indian Railways. Finally, we try to find solutions to avoid such national disasters in the future.

India has the lowest divorce rate in the world! That should be a good thing, right? On the face of it, it shows that Indians are so much better at maintaining marriages. But are we, really? In this video, we talk about why the divorce rates in India are so low- one of the main reasons being the stigma against the idea of divorce. We also talk about how slowly but surely, the stigma is fading and more and more people are choosing to walk out of unhappy and abusive marriages- addressing the reasons behind such decisions as well. 
While making this video, we interviewed a couple of people for their opinions and experience about divorces in India and we'd like to thank them for their contribution. Both of them run support groups-Their details are mentioned below in case you want to reach out to them:

The Arabian society of the past was predominantly organized along tribal lines, with tribes like the Quraysh holding significant influence and power, while others like the Khazraj faced lower social standing. It was within this dynamic atmosphere that Prophet Muhammad, himself from the influential Quraysh tribe, began spreading the message of Islam, emphasizing the equality of all individuals in the eyes of God.
However, it is intriguing to note that, similar to Hindu society, a form of caste system has emerged within the Muslim community in India. In this video, we will delve into the origins and development of caste discrimination among Indian Muslims, seeking a deeper understanding of how and why this phenomenon came to be.

During the 1980s, mainstream Hindi movies were going through a tough time. The decade was most often referred to as the “lost decade” and is remembered for its “trashy” content. Some commentators have called this a “blot” on the history of Indian cinema. 

But during the same decade, a parallel movement was brewing and a new kind of cinema emerged- often referred to as B-Grade movies. These movies had an important influence on mainstream movies by introducing genres like horror and sex. 

In this video, we trace the journey of B-grade movies from its rise in the 1980s, its evolution in the 1990s and its fall in the 2000s, and its rise again in the form of OTT.

Description: Country A and Country B share a border and unfortunately, Country B suffers a defeat in a war against Country A. As a response, Country B seeks to establish a separatist group with the aim of challenging Country A. This scenario may bring to mind the historical context of India and Pakistan, where Pakistan has been known to support and train separatist groups against India. However, it is noteworthy that India, too, has been involved in supporting and training separatist groups in its neighboring countries.

In this video, we delve into the complex dynamics of India's involvement in supporting separatist groups in China, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Moreover, we explore how this particular foreign policy approach can occasionally lead to unintended consequences and may not necessarily prove to be an effective tool in the long run.

Manipur has been on the boil these days- cars have been torched, people have lost their lives, a curfew has been imposed and the army has been brought in. All because of a High Court order- to consider the plea of the Meitei community in Manipur to be included in the Scheduled Tribes of India. But the issue is not a new one. The Meiteis have long been demanding to be declared as STs and the other tribes of the state- the Nagas and the Kukus are determined to not let that happen. 
Why is that? Why do the Meiteis want the ST tag and why are the other tribes so dead against it?
In this video, we delve into history to find the roots of this conflict and also talk about how this has impacted the daily lives of the people in Manipur.

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's death has been one of the biggest mysteries of modern India. Nearly eight decades after his disappearance in 1945, people still don't agree about what happened to him. While initial government investigations concluded that Netaji died in a plane crash in present-day Taipei, many saw loopholes in this account and provided alternate theories. One theory states that he somehow managed to make his way to the Soviet Union, where he was captured by Joseph Stalin's forces. Yet another theory says that Netaji didn't die until much later and lived as an ascetic in various parts of India. What really happened and how do we solve this mystery? We examine the evidence available for each theory and reach our own conclusion.

In Pakistan, a few memes are going viral. One thing unique about them: The memes have photos of Hindu Gods. 
Muhammed Ali Jinnah said ""you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the state.”
However, the reality for religious minorities in Pakistan today is far from ideal, with instances of forced conversions, discrimination, and violence being reported. This is a complex and deeply concerning issue that demands attention and action. What does this tell about the place of Hindus and minorities in Pakistani society? We take a look at this problem in this video.

But then, there is a flip side to this story as well- More and more startups in India can be seen laying off their employees and they are struggling to survive.
A study even showed that around 90% of Indian startups fail within the first 5 years. 
But why is that? If India has such a huge market of around- 140 crore people and investors have so much faith in Indian startups, why are they struggling to survive?
This is what we are going to talk about in this video What ails the startups of India and what is the way out for them?

The state of Haryana is a picture of contrasts- on one hand, it is counted among the states having the highest per capita income. On the other hand, it suffers such a massive problem of unemployment that it has had the highest rates of unemployment in the country at least 30 times- if you observe the monthly data from 2016. 
The contrast is clear: Haryana is rich but at the same time, a lot of people in Haryana are unemployed.
So, what are the reasons behind this?
This is exactly what we will try and understand in this video: tracing Haryana's history to becoming the richest state in India and then talking about why it faces such a high level of unemployment

As we all saw, UP mafia don turned politician Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf were gunned down on live television. The news immediately prompted severe, polarizing reactions, not only from India but everywhere else too. While many celebrated the death of a dreaded criminal who had been responsible for a reign of terror in Uttar Pradesh for four decades, others saw the killing as a complete breakdown of law and order. When I conducted a poll on my YouTube community page, the responses were equally divisive. So, I began to wonder why some people celebrated, while others thought Ahmed's killing set a dangerous precedent for our democracy. My friend ButWhy and I got together, and we tried to analyze the arguments both for and against the killing and reach our own conclusion.

4wHzRe-46yU,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Why Haryanvi Songs are Dominating YouTube,"Did you know that after Hindi and Punjabi, Haryanvi is the most popular language for songs on YouTube in India? In fact, out of the top 100 most viewed songs from India, Haryana alone has 12 songs on the list. The rise of Haryanvi music can be attributed to several factors, including the regional appeal and relatability of the artists, the performance of Haryanvi athletes at international sporting events, and smartphone accessibility. With catchy beats, foot-tapping rhythms, and vibrant visuals, Haryanvi songs are highly shareable and enjoyable, making them a hit with audiences across India and beyond. Until a few years ago, not a single Haryanvi song made it to the top 10 on YouTube. However, with the rise of social media and the growing demand for regional content, Haryanvi music has emerged as a force to be reckoned with, challenging the dominance of Hindi and Punjabi in the Indian music industry.

bm7spkT8w5Q,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Truth about Bageshwar Dham Baba,"We have a new spiritual guru and guide on the block: Baba Bageshwar Dham. He is like any other babas: he claims he can heal people and gives them strange, quick solutions to people’s problems
He is even known to read people’s minds and offer them a way out of their miseries without the people even telling him anything.
One organization from Maharashtra decided to challenge this. They asked the baba to perform the miracle of mind reading on 10 people of their choice. What the Baba did was pretty predictable. He cut short his visit to Maharashtra and ran away
He was also in news for not allowing a person from a lower caste to touch his feet 
But despite such problematic streaks, the baba is still very popular among the people. The same could be seen in the cases of earlier babas like Ram Rahim and Asaram Bapu
So, why is it that Indians regularly flock to these babas- and they don’t seem to care about their wrongdoings?
This is what we talk about in this video. We also touch upon why such blind belief is problematic and what we could do to address this problem.

YH1H-FEqRyc,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Why are Punjabis Decreasing in Indian Army?,"Over the years, Punjabis, particularly Sikhs have formed a major part of the Indian army. But did you know that they were present in even larger numbers in the British Indian army? Earlier, the British mainly had upper-caste Hindus and Muslims in their army- but then came the revolt of 1857. And that changed the status quo. More and more Punjabis (majorly Sikhs) began to be recruited in the British Indian Army. The dominance of Punjabis and Sikhs in the army continued even after independence- though somewhat in a milder form. But recently, these numbers have been declining. So much so that Punjab, which used to send the highest number of officers and recruits in the army- has been overtaken by other states. 
What could be the reasons behind this? In this video, we talk about what are the major reasons why Punjabis and Sikhs were recruited into the army in such large numbers and then go on to discuss what are the reasons for the decline in this trend.

WngejdXGvnU,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Gay Marriage in India,"The Supreme Court of India is currently deliberating on a case that could change the course of history for crores of people. The case, which seeks to legalize same-sex marriages in the country, is being hailed as a ""seminal issue"", and it's clear why. The petitioners argue that denying same-sex couples the right to marry is a violation of their fundamental human rights and dignity. On the other hand, the government believes that legalizing such marriages could lead to a breakdown in societal values. This debate raises important questions about our society and what we stand for. Should everyone have the right to marry the person they love, regardless of their gender? Should we prioritize societal values over human rights and dignity? These are questions that we try to answer in this video.

ubUIoLRekbs,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Pakistan's Economic Crisis,"Pakistan, as we know, is facing an unprecedented economic crisis. The prices of food have sky rocketed, malls and offices are being shut down and people are being advised to drink less tea so that the government can save money! Some people are even saying that India should help Pakistan out. 
In the midst of all of this, the Pakistani PM has called for making peace with India. 
He says that after three wars, Pakistan has learnt its lesson. 
But this is not the first time Pakistan has been talking about peace. Several attempts to establish peace have been made in the past.
But peace has been elusive so far.
So, could this time be different? Should India help Pakistan? Would that buy us peace in return?
This is what we are going to talk about in this video. We also discuss why our previous attempts of peace with Pakistan have failed and why this time the situation could be different, if India decides to help at all.

It’s not just the tourists – such behaviour by Indian men is pretty common when it comes to women. And it’s not limited to the physical world; you can find plenty of creepy Indian men online. So, why is it that Indian men are so creepy? Are they really to blame or are there more complex issues at work? Can we really blame a nation of more than 70 crore men for the actions of a few? We delve into what might seem like an amusing problem – but is actually a profound one – in this video.

ZK843wTJU6c,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,North vs South India on Taxes,"We all know that the Central Indian government redistributes the taxes that it receives from the different states. But while some states in the North - like Bihar - receive a lot more than they pay as direct tax to the Centre, others such as Tamil Nadu receive far lesser. This has led many South Indians with a sense of resentment against the Northern states, with the argument being that the Central government is actively discriminating against them. This argument is strengthened when you see the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, the body that regulates how much money is to be given to states. But the Northern states argue that historical policies have given the South an advantage. We dive into the complex history and policies behind this issue to determine who is truly right in the latest video.

wKKe-wt-PTQ,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,What is Wrong with Indian Liberals,"We often see the hardcore Modi supporters or the ""right wing"" populace being attacked in liberal circles. They are made fun of, ridiculed and even shamed for not being ""open"" enough to see reason. But have you ever wondered that the liberals might be doing the same thing? For instance, many of those people that identify themselves as ""liberals"" have chosen to cut off friends that are Modi supporters. Why is that? Is it not okay to have an opinion that is different? And more importantly, if you're not even willing to give the other person the space to voice their opinions or to entertain their ideas, are you even a liberal? This is precisely what we will address in today's video- the problems with some liberals today. We will also try and understand what shapes the ideologies of people and what makes them ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" while also seeing why the existence of both these sections is important for the society to exist.

EWtYky_HjhM,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Being Single in India,"For years and years, the institution of marriage has been very important in Indian society. But in recent years, there’s a different trend that is being noticed- there has been a rise in the number of people who are opting to remain single. The reasons are many- some like the freedom that comes with it, some have decided to wait until they find the right person, no matter how long it takes and some have decided to stay single after a bad experience with a partner/spouse. 
But Being single in India Sucks! 
Singles are being discriminated against in all spheres- “Bachelors/Spinsters are not allowed” is something we very commonly see in housing societies
In this video, we discuss these forms of discrimination faced by single people and try to understand what drives the society to discriminate against them in this way.

dryi0WDXhes,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Khalistan Movement in Punjab,"There is a new leader emerging in the turf of Punjab- Amritpal Singh Sandhu. A few years ago, he was an unknown figure who was living in Dubai- today, he is calling for social and religious transformation of Punjab. 
At the same time, he is also talking about Khalistan: a separate homeland for the Sikhs.  His story sounds strikingly similar to a young leader who had emerged in the 1980s- Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He had been calling for the transformation of Punjab and raising demands for Khalistan. 
The worrisome thing is- last time, things ended in a very ugly manner. 
Naturally, Indian leaders are worried - what does Amritpal Singh want? Why did he become so popular suddenly? And what does the future hold for Punjab? 
These are the questions we ponder about in this video.

MBXP7rfHQJY,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Reality of Aurangzeb,"How did Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's actions shape his legacy? Was he a ruthless tyrant, a religious zealot, or a political opportunist? These questions have been the subject of debate for centuries, and continue to be so today. In fact, Aurangzeb's legacy has become increasingly politicized in contemporary India, with his reputation being challenged by the country's Hindu right-wing.Despite his controversial reputation for persecution of Hindus, historians suggest that Aurangzeb's political ambitions were not specifically targeted at any religious group. In this video, we delve into Aurangzeb's life, reign, and legacy, exploring the contradictions and controversies that surround him.

Lithium, also known as ""white gold"", is a critical component in rechargeable batteries, particularly for electric vehicles. As the electric vehicle industry is expected to grow 7x by 2030, this discovery provides India with the opportunity to move up the global supply chain and become a leader in the EV industry. Despite the challenges, such as the absence of cell manufacturing in India and the possibility of lithium batteries being replaced in EVs, India has the potential to exploit its natural resources and become a hub for EV production. Will the discovery prove a turning point? Will this make India the next superpower?

Spanning from coal-power to renewable energy, infrastructure to transmission, there is hardly anything left untouched by the Adani Group of industries. But the empire's growth story suffered its biggest blow yet with the publishing of the Hindenburg report, that alleged that Adani had pulled off the biggest con in corporate history. It raised serious allegations about financial fraud and stock manipulation, resulting in the single-biggest erosion in Adani stocks. But Adani claims the report is a result of a malicious attempt to defame not only the company, but India. Whatever the truth, Adani's investors are already sitting on the precipice of disaster. What next?

We all know that India and Pakistan are both nuclear nations, but have you ever wondered about the nuclear policies of the two countries? A country's nuclear policy is important because it dictates how it plans to use the weapons in case of a war. While India has maintained a ""no first use"" policy for decades - meaning it won't ever use nuclear weapons first - Pakistan hasn't made any such promises. Why? Shouldn't it concern India that in the event of a war, there are no guarantees that Pakistan won't use nuclear weapons first? We anaylze India's position on the use of its nuclear weapons, but even more importantly, we discuss the growing calls by experts to change India's nuclear policy because it's not Pakistan we need to be worried about now - but China! Watch the video to find out more.

Weddings are, more often than not, a reason for a huge celebration. In India, we take weddings very seriously! Lengthy guest lists, themed decorations, loud bands and a sumptuous food spread- we have it all! But all that comes at a huge cost- A report suggests that  60% of Indian famillies spend more than their annual income on expenditures at a wedding! Which then brings us to our main question- Why do Indians spend so much on weddings? Those that are in favour of lavish weddings would say the reason is obvious- its a once in a lifetime event- we all need to celebrate our big day. But there are others who believe that it is a waste of money- that it is not okay to spend so much on just one celebration. In this video, we discuss the lavish Indian wedding celebrations, with a peek into the past. We even try and look into both the positive and the negative aspects of such spendings.

""Mera beta IITian banega"" is a phrase you often hear in Indian households. The dream of becoming an IITian is ingrained in the minds of many Indian students and their families. The IIT brand is seen as a beacon of hope, a ticket to upward mobility and social status. Students spend years pouring over textbooks, sacrificing their social lives, and attending coaching centers in pursuit of this dream. But do the Indian Institutes of Technology truly deliver on these aspirations? Are they really that different from other engineering colleges in India?

In this video, we take a closer look at the quality of IITs and explore whether the ""IIT brand"" is just hype or if it can truly be justified. We'll dive into the facts and figures, and ask the question on everyone's mind - is the IIT dream worth the sacrifices?

There are youth organizations who demand different things from their elected leaders. Some want employment, some want reservation, but now there are youth groups who want wives! Yes, a lot of men in India - especially in states like Haryana - are unable to find wives and therefore aren't getting married. Why is this happening? Is it because women's choices have changed or is it something else? And while not being able to find wives is out of their control, there're also men who are not marrying out of choice. Stats show fewer men are marrying today in India than ten years ago, while the population of eligible bachelors has increased. What is the real reason behind this phenomenon and how is it impacting the lives of men and women across the country? Let's find out.

Do you remember the Bihar toppergate scandal when the state toppers made national news for all the wrong reasons? One year later, another scandal hit Bihar's education system as two in every three students failed to pass the 12th Board exams. While these instances might seem funny from the outside, they are stark examples of everything that is wrong with the education system in Bihar. Ultimately, it's the students whose careers are jeopardized. Bihar's education system is beset by corruption and presided over by what is known as ""Bihar's education mafia"". In this video, we discuss how Bihar allowed its education levels to stoop to such levels, and what can be done about it now.

But do you know there is another class of Punjabis who are moving to Europe to create a better future for themselves? These young men and women belong to poor, rural families who move abroad with hopes of financial security. Often times, they take massive loans and debts to facilitate this process. However, this migration has a very dark side and it's young Punjabi people and families who are suffering because of it. What is it exactly and how does it work? Let's find out in the video.

India has been a hub of kidney rackets for a long time. A decade ago, it was estimated that a fifth of the illegal kidney transplants in the world took place in India. These rackets are very elaborate and organised. The organisers of these rackets live lavish lifestyles while the poor who are usually targeted for donations are exploited the most. The reason why these rackets exist is because there is a huge shortfall of organ donations in India due to religious and emotional reasons. Because of this shortage patients have to rely on black market operations. But these could be eliminated if organ donations increase.

You might have seen our recent video on the Pakistani economy. In the video, we discussed the various reasons that for the crisis in Pakistani economy. India, on the other hand, is doing much despite the stresses of Covid. But you might be surprised to know that there was a time when Pakistan had a better economy than India, with Pakistan’s GDP per capita significantly higher than India in the early 1980s. Today, however, India has far outpaced Pakistan’s growth. How has that happened? As we’ll see in this video, it’s a fascinating assortment of reasons, all of which we have discussed in detail.

We all know the prestige Indians attach to government jobs. Not only IAS and IPS, even low-ranking government jobs are highly coveted by Indians. How is it that even 30 years after liberalization the Indian youth still prefers the government sector over the private sector? We discuss the reasons behind this obsession which is more complicated than you might think. But even more importantly, we dissect the consequences of this fascination Indians have with government jobs, and show that it's not only harmful for the aspirants, but for the country as well. Wondering how? Watch the video to find out.

Since last year, we have had a string of celebrities dying of heart ailments. TV actor Siddharth Shukla and Kannada superstar Puneeth Rajkumar - both regular gym-goers in their 40s - died because of massive cardiac arrests. It's not just celebrities, statistics show more and more young Indians are dying of heart-related ailments than ever before in history. Why are the hearts of young Indians in such bad shape? As this video will show, it's a combination of factors including bad diet, our modern work culture and even social media!

We all come across beggars almost daily in our lives. While we often wonder whether we should give them money or not, a more important question escapes us: why do so many beggars exist in our country in the first place? Many of us tend to think that most beggars are part of a syndicate that is run by an underground mafia, but such assumptions often have no grounds in evidence. Instead, problems of poverty, migration and even religion lie at the heart of the begging problem. In this video, we discuss these factors in detail while also emphasizing on what needs to be done to alleviate the problem.

Whether it’s the midterms in our school, entrance exams to colleges and universities, or competitive exams for jobs, Indians have to be ready for exams every step of the way. In recent times, more and more of these exams are adopting the MCQ format. While some say that this makes the assessment process inexpensive and takes less time, others say the format limits the holistic development of any student. But the real answer is not quite so straightforward, with multiple factors to consider, all of which we discuss in this video.

You might have come across viral videos recently, in which the former president of China was made to leave to leave the Communist Party's Congress. The visuals caused a lot of speculation all over the world, with observers worried that president China was becoming even more authoritarian under President Xi Jinping. The concerns are justified, as Xi Jinping has taken steps to consolidate his position as the supreme leader of China, beginning with the abolition of presidential term limits back in 2018. But some other moves undertaken by him to consolidate his power are lesser-known. In this video, we discuss what those steps have been, and how has Xi Jinping managed to execute them.

Until the 1920s, two of the oldest civilizations known to the world were the civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia. But all that changed when officers of the Archaeological Survey of India found evidence of an ancient civilization along the banks of the Indus river. The Indus Valley Civilization was home to one of the ancient world's most developed societies. But we still don't know what language the people of this civilization spoke. It remains one of the most enduring mysteries of our time. But today, researchers are using AI to help us decode the Indus script. In this video, we discuss the reasons why deciphering the script has eluded the best of us, and whether we can are any closer to decoding it than we were a hundred years ago.

With digitization increasing exponentially, semiconductors have become one of the most prized technologies in the world today. All electronic devices - big and small - contain semiconductor microchips, resulting in a worldwide race among countries to become the leader in semiconductor design and manufacturing. Historically, the U.S. has led in semiconductor technology, and with their support, today Taiwan is the biggest producer of semiconductors. But China has slowly been gaining ground, with reports that under Xi Jinping, the Chinese military is using semiconductors to develop AI weapon systems. As a result, America has banned the export of all semiconductor software and components to China, forcing companies like Apple to look for alternatives. In this video, we discuss why India is well-placed to benefit from these developments and replace China to become a leader in semiconductor technology.

All of us have heard about ISKCON but we know a little about their history. It started as a small movement in Bengal with the followers continuously chanting 'Hare Krishna'. Soon, this movement took over the world under Swami Prabhupada. In this video we talk about its history and how it reached the foreign countries in detail. We also cover the various controversies that it has been involved in. But, with more than 600 centres in the world and powerful donors to back then up, ISKCON remains one of the largest religious movements in the world.

A few years ago, the Indian Army tweeted pictures reportedly belonging to a Yeti, a strange creature that is believed to inhabit remote regions of the Himalayas. This was not the first time that evidence supposedly proving the existence of Yeti had been put forward. Since 1921, mountaineers and adventure-seekers have sought to come across a Yeti, and even hunt it, but they have ultimately been unsuccessful. However, numerous photographs of the strange creature and body parts reportedly belonging to Yetis have been recovered from the region. So, does that mean that Yetis exist? We examine the evidence and see if they hold up under scrutiny.

In 1995, India was brought to a standstill when a Ganesha idol in New Delhi started drinking milk. Within a few hours, it was reported that Ganesha idols not only up and down the country, but even in foreign countries like the US and UK had started drinking milk. What was causing this strange phenomenon? Experts tried to show that there was a simple scientific explanation behind the miracle, and yet people thronged to temples, skyrocketing the price of milk on that day. The crowds included educated people in urban areas, so how was it that these people believed in the miracle too? Was it orchestrated, or did people actually believe in the miracle of gods drinking milk? Our investigation has shown that it was both, as we'll tell you in this video.

We have often heard about the toxic sales culture at Byju’s, something I discussed in a previous video. But did you hear that Byju’s released its financial report for the FY21 recently? The Indian unicorn posted massive losses, while its revenues are lesser than the year before. Even then, Byju’s has continued to acquire companies like Aakash and Great Learning. How is that possible for a company which is struggling financially? More importantly, though, is a bigger question: Why is Byju’s struggling so badly? I discuss the intriguing answers to all these questions in the video.

You must have come across the viral videos showing people being bitten by dogs in recent times. While pet dogs have been responsible for many of these unprovoked attacks, the stray dog situation is becoming a massive problem in our country. It has become so bad that in Kerala the state government decided to approach the Supreme Court for permission to kill dangerous dogs. While the moral implications of such a decision are certainly debatable, it does point to a pertinent question: how do we deal with our dogs? We have co-existed in harmony for much of our existence, so why is it that now we can't quite seem to? In this video we delve into the reasons for the increasing dog attacks, discuss the pros and cons of mass culling, and find out what we can do - as animal lovers - so that the existence of neither species is threatened.

In 1994, the Idgah Maidan in Karnataka's Hubli district witnessed a storm of protesters. The protest was led by leaders of  BJP on Independence day who wanted to hoist the Indian flag in the Maidan. Result? Ten of the protesters died in the process as the state government intervened. Cut to 2022, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the very same maidan without any fuss. 
From 1994 to 2022, a lot has changed in Karnataka. A maidan claimed by a religious sect,  where once hoisting the national flag was impossible has just witnessed a festival of another religion being celebrated in its premise. How did that happen? Be it the inception of Hijab Ban controversy, mandating Bhagwat Gita in school curriculum or banning muslim vendors from temple vicinity; there's a visible rise of Hindutva in the state. But popular beliefs suggest that South India generally repeals religious politics. So why is Karnataka moving towards Hindutva? We answer that in this video

In October 2019, two scientific reports were out. Both of them talked about how North Indians and South Indians came to the Indian subcontinent and threw light on the Aryan Invasion Theory. But how different media houses projected the findings was interesting. 
While one side said Aryan Invasion Theory has been debunked and all the Indians came to India at once, the other side claimed the theory has been upheld and South Indians and North Indians have originated differently.
The truth lies somewhere in between. We dug out the findings of the papers to understand how humans actually came to India, are South Indians and North Indians different genetically and how politics has been complicating our understanding of India's evolution.

We've all used UPI and know how convenient, secure and quick it is. Rightly hailed as one of the best deep-tech innovations to have come out of India in this century, the success of the UPI model has made countries like France and USA study the financial payment system, with some like Nepal even adopting it. But a major reason behind UPI growing by leaps and bounds over the last couple of years has been the government's decision to make it free. It has made UPI the undisputed first-choice for millions of users and retailers across the country. But what if I tell you that UPI shouldn't be free, because in the long-run, making UPI free does the system more harm than good. In this video, we'll find out why UPI shouldn't be free, and if the government was to reverse its decision, what it would mean for users like you and me.

India is full of Munna Bhais. A WHO study says that more than half of the doctors in India are fake. But they are very popular in rural India, this is because there is shortage of doctors in rural India and to a large extent the medical education system is to be blamed. Due to this shortage, these informal doctors help fill the gap in rural healthcare but can also prove to be fatal as we see in the case of Unnao. Some believe that training them is right way to go ahead but institutions like the Indian Medical Council are strictly against it. So, the operations of fake doctors of India remain under question.

Do you remember the last Bollywood movie you absolutely loved? Chances are that you will have to think hard about it, because Bollywood movies are not really setting the world alight anymore. 2022 has been a terrible year for Hindi-language films with multiple flops so far, a continuation of the trend that started during the pandemic. In contrast, big-budget South Indian flicks are tearing up the box office. People have given different theories for Bollywood's decline, both in quality and box-office numbers. In this video, I dissect those theories to see if they are valid, and tell you about the ones that have actually contributed to the present state of beloved film industry.

Netflix show 'Indian Matchmaking' has once again brought the topic of the ""big, fat Indian wedding"" to the fore. The institution of marriage is important everywhere, but in India, it's often the most important event of an adult's life. While we know that things like caste and religion play a big role in arranged Indian marriages, there are other less-talked about things that young Indians are actively looking for in their prospective partners. In this video, we look at what those things are, and how and why they affect marriage choices among both Indian women and men. We attempt to draw conclusions about factors that decide Indian marriages based on the data and evidence available to us.

West Bengal's economy is in one of its worst phase right now. Since 2011, it's per capita GDP has remained lower than that of all-India average. And its manufacturing and service sector are also crumbling down. But guess what concides with this development? The rise of Mamata Banerjee. Since 2011, Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress has increased its vote share in every election, except one. So what explains such contrary developments? We'll discuss that in this video.

""There is not and never was an India,” were the words spoken by former British civil servant John Strachey in a series of lectures he gave in Cambridge in 1888. Unfortunately, this view was not limited to him. Many other officials and political thinkers believed that if India would ever become independent, it’d fall into chaos and anarchy. 75 years later, we have proved them all wrong. How did we reach here? Despite the many problems that an independent India has faced, we have not only managed to survive but we have taken strides in many fields. In this video, we discuss the steps taken by India to ensure that the country was able to address its most pressing concerns. And in doing so, we have managed to resolve many of the problems that’d threaten the unity of our country.

Now when I tell you that seemingly unrelated incident was actually meant to boost Pakistan’s economy, will you be surprised? But that’s exactly what some experts reckon. Pakistan is going through one of the worst economic crises in their history, with the Pakistani rupee currently the worst-performing currency in Asia. And it needs another IMF financial bailout if it has to survive and not follow in Sri Lanka’s footsteps into economic disaster. How have our neighbours reached this position? We examine if Pakistan’s current situation is a result of recent global developments like the Ukraine-Russia war, or if has been a long time in the making.

There are so many hindi/urdu words that could have rhymed with Kesariya so why did Amitabh Bhattacharya choose ""Love Storiyaan""? If this question crossed your mind after listening to the much anticipated Kesariya song from Brahmastra, I have an answer for you. This has happened because of a recent trend in the music industry wherein songs are being composed to go viral on Instagram Reels. Critics call this phenomenon as Tiktokification ( Of course in absence of Tik Tok in India, it's happening on its closest adversary, Reels) In this video, we discuss how Instagram Reels is changing the face of Indian music.

But unlike conventional wars, there's a clear winner before conclusion: teachers. Top faculties are getting paid remuneration in crores to teach physics, chemistry and maths to high school students. In this video, we discuss the current war in Kota between established coaching centres and ed-tech companies and how it's impacting the indian education industry

What goes on in your mind when you see news headlines like these: ""Nora Fateh turns up the heat in an animal print bikini"" or ""Mallaika Arora bra pehne bina ghar se doggy ko tehlaane nikli, tasveerey ho rahi hai viral"".  I beleive you resonate our feelings: IS THAT NEWS? But what if I tell you these and such similar headlines appear on the web portals of established media houses like News 18, NDTV and the Times of India all the time.  If you closely observe these articles, there's a pattern; they are similarly worded, they use a lot of explicit images and they are one of the most viewed articles on the news portal. While we might thing such clickbaits are the real problem, they are not. They are one of the consequences of a gradual shift in our media consumption and a broken business model. In this video we discuss how one of the oldest media business models is ruining the news for us.

#SCALER #CREATEIMPACT

******

Government data shows that there are more Nepalis than Gujaratis in the Army. And people have frequently targeted Gujaratis for not being in the army and therefore, blamed them for faking patriotism. But, there are various reasons for the lack of participation in the army by Gujaratis. These include historical as well as cultural reasons. And in the end, we should remember that we cannot measure a state's patriotism by the number of soldiers it send to the Army. Gujaratis contributes to the nation in many other ways. And in this video we look at the different reasons as to why many Gujaratis are NOT in the Indian Army?

It's been almost two years since Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput passed away. But on Twitter, he still has an afterlife. No one of us can forget the massive outrage and somewhat bizarre media coverage that Sushant' death got. Although, the TV media doesn't discuss his death much but if you look at Twitter, there are thousands of tweets with hashtags containing the word Sushant or SSR. Like in January 2022 #FasttrackJustice4SSR had around 40 thousand tweets. This trended on number 7 in India on January 17th. This is strange because two years after the death of any celebrity, a movement tends to die. So why, is the Why is #SSR movement still going strong? Let's find out in this video

Data shows that obesity is on a rise in India. There are a few reasons that already make Indians fat but recent lifestyle changes are contributing to this existing problem and causing it to become a serious issue for us. At the same time, undernourishment is still prevalent in the country, so we have to fight two battles together.

As one travels across Bihar and UP in North India, one may encounter orchestra shows colloquially known as ‘Arkestra’. These arkestra programs are a mixed set-up which typically involves a dancer who is usually a woman, a DJ and a chunk of local pop music. Many people come to watch these dance girls. What is this business of dance girls?

The states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were once a single state known as the state of Bombay under the British. Upon independence, there were demands to create separate states of Gujarat and Maharashtra on the basis of language. The centre didn't want this but appointed several commissions to look into this matter. Finally, when protests grew from both the Marathi and Gujarati sides, the centre divided the state of Bombay into Maharashtra and Gujarat on May 1,1960.

Should you be allowed to criticise someone's god without the fear of retribution ? When does criticism actually become hate speech? Can you protest if you are offended? What should be the scale of your protest? If you damage public property while protesting, how should the state handle you? Is collective punishment justifiable ?
Beyond the hashtag #ISupportNupur and #ArrestNupur, these are the primary questions any sane mind would contemplate upon, in light of the Nupur Sharma controversy. 
The controversy refuses to die down two weeks after ex BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma commented an objectionable take on Prophet Muhammad. Much has happened since then. Through this video, we are addressing some of the fundamental questions related to this controversy

It is true that behind Modi's immense electoral and political success there is politics based on Hindutva and Nationalism. And we and numerous others have talked about it a lot. But sometimes our PM delivers too. This video is about one such instance when PM Modi's scheme has brought a remarkable transformation in the weaker section of our society. The scheme in discussion is JAL JEEVAN SCHEME aka Har Ghar Jal. We shall discuss in this video how in just two years PM modi's Har Ghar Jal managed to provide tap water connection to around 9 crore rural households of India? And what did it do differently from the previous similar schemes to stand out?

If you are not living under a rock and you come from 98% of India's economic class, you must have experienced something lately: things are getting really expensive. And it's not only you who are impacted by inflation, often when there's hyper-inflation in  a country, it has brought down highly popular governments. But, why now? What happened suddenly that everything started getting so expensive? And how is the government reacting to it? In this video we discuss all that.

Last year, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath spoke of the declining unemployment figures in his state. He claimed that Uttar Pradesh's unemployment rate has dipped from 17% in 2017 to 5% in 2021. While Adityanath's claim was not faulty, the rationale behind it was. Unemployment rate didn't fall because people got jobs, but because people stopped looking for one. And this phenomenon is not only restricted to Uttar Pradesh. Between 2017 to 2022, 40% of India's working population stopped looking for a job, a figure that equals the combined population of Russia and the U.S. So why is it happening? Watch the video to find out..

Free electricity is one of the most popular schemes of the  AAP-led Delhi Government. Though AAP justifies its  business model with the use of some data but this model is broken. Do you know an average Indian household receives only 20.4 hours of electricity under normal circumstances? There are several memes that show the frustration of consumers who pay for electricity but still have to suffer from power cuts. Why? The issue is we believe electricity is our right. And in this video, we'll analyse in-depth why Electricity Subsidies is a bad idea

Description

******
A market in Manipur's Imphal houses over 4000 vendors, all of them women. This marketplace is a mini representation of Manipur's society, where women are at the forefront of running the economy. And not just the economy, historically important social movements have been spearheaded by women. But while this matrilineal setup has ensured women do not remain a passive spectator, it still hasn't been able to push their political participation. Infact, Manipur remains one of the worst Indian states when it comes to women leaders. So why is this? We discuss that in this video.

In 1917, the Mexican communist party was established. The man behind the formation  was not a Mexican, but an Indian. It was MN Roy, a highly motivated communist revolutionary who had escaped to Mexico because of a completely different reason. His endeavours to get India independent took him to different parts of the world, and forming the communist party of mexico, was just one of this endeavour. His loyalty towards communism drew him close to Lenin, who trusted him to seed India's communist party as well. But, the man who led the formation of communist parties in two countries abandoned communism a few years later. In this video we narrate this fascinating story of one of India's first global leaders.

iD0X3ZcZeCY,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Bihar has no industries. Why?,"The first 1000 people to use this link will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare- https://skl.sh/sochbymohakmangal04221

******

In the last twenty years, Bihar has been able to overcome the stereotypical image it was subjected to. Between 2006 and 2011, while the growth rate of other states (in terms of GSDP) was stagnating, Bihar’s GSDP was growing at double the rate it grew in the last 5 years.
But one problem stuck with the state even after this immense growth: be it in the manufacturing sector, or the service sector, Bihar was unable to establish industries. CM Nitish Kumar and other leaders from the state have asserted that Bihar lacks industry because it has no port. But Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, are also landlocked, and still have industries 2 or 3 times more than Bihar. So is it Bihar’s image causing it to lose out on industries? Well partly, but there are other contemporary reasons which are pulling the state down. In this video, we will discuss those very reasons..

hspbJ1fGaoo,UCz4a7agVFr1TxU-mpAP8hkw,Why are Indian men LIKE THIS?,"While on a walk at the beach or on the way to work, we see men holding hands all the time. This happens all around us and hence is not something that peaks our attention. But when Vincent Dolman, a British photographer noticed this on his trip to India, he found it to be very interesting and started documenting the same. It was something very alien to him and where he was from. So it begs the question, why do Indian Men hold hands and why is it not a universal phenomenon?

As Navratri began, demands for banning meat to respect Hindu sentiments resurfaced. And it was not an unprecedented demand; time and again food politics has been a hot topic that had led to controversies, moral policing and sometimes even violence. But is that it? Or does meat ban demand actually makes any sense? In this video, we sought to answer both side of the arguments on meat ban

With that it has become the fourth political party in independent India's history to have a CM in more than one state. And if we see, that is a huge achievement Because unlike the other three parties (BJP, CPI+ CPI (M) and Congress) AAP is neither driven by an ideology nor does it have a historical legacy. 
So how did a nine-year-old party manage to win two states within such a short span of time? We discuss that in this video.

Since 1949, the relationship between China and Taiwan has remained tense.
China considers Taiwan as its breakaway province whereas Taiwan considers itself as an independent country. Chinese President Xi Jingping has vowed to reunify Taiwan with China at any cost. However, Taiwan has refused to bow against Chinese authority and is preparing to defend its sovereignty. Citing the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, many analysts are exploring the question- Will Taiwan become the next Ukraine?

Being a former member of the Soviet Union, Ukraine shares a common history with Russia. However, the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated over the years. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 has triggered Ukraine’s desire to Join NATO. This has forced one man to action- Vladimir Putin. However, that’s just not it, there’s more behind- Why Putin really wants to invade Ukraine?

“Math is not a girl subject, boys are much better at it.” How many times have we heard this stereotype? Data indicates that Girls have scored consistently less in Math than boys over the years. As a result, there is a significant gender gap in Mathematics in India. So, why really do girls get LOWER marks in Math in India?

Through interviews with experts and analysis of past elections, it sheds light on how media and public perception are shaped by these early projections and the caution required in interpreting their results.

The Nirav Modi scam, one of India's largest financial frauds, unfolded in 2018 when billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi, along with his family and associates, allegedly defrauded Punjab National Bank (PNB) of over $2 billion. Modi and his accomplices purportedly obtained fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) to secure credit from other banks, using these funds for personal gain and to sustain his luxury lifestyle. The scandal rocked India's banking sector, revealing systemic vulnerabilities and prompting widespread scrutiny of regulatory oversight and corporate governance practices.

Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, originally included as a temporary provision, grants special autonomous status to the region of Jammu and Kashmir. Enacted in 1949, it allows the state to have its own constitution, flag, and governing authority, with the central government's jurisdiction limited to defense, foreign affairs, and communications. Over time, Article 370 has been a subject of controversy, with debates over its effectiveness in maintaining stability in the region versus accusations of perpetuating separatism. Its abrogation in August 2019 by the Indian government sparked both celebration and protest, significantly altering the political landscape of Jammu and Kashmir.

The dark reality of fantasy apps in India unveils a shadowy side marked by addictive behaviors, financial risks, and ethical concerns. While initially celebrated for merging sports passion with skill-based gaming, these apps have drawn attention for their potential to exacerbate gambling tendencies, leading to financial losses for vulnerable users. The exploitative marketing tactics employed by some platforms have raised ethical questions, underscoring the need for stringent regulations. The dark underbelly of these apps, characterized by an undercurrent of addiction and the erosion of responsible gaming principles, underscores the imperative for a more transparent and responsible industry framework in India.

Iran's animosity towards the USA is deeply rooted in historical grievances, notably the controversial 1953 coup that ousted Prime Minister Mossadegh and installed the Shah, widely seen as a U.S.-backed intervention. The 1979 Islamic Revolution, which overthrew the Shah, further strained relations, leading to the hostage crisis. Perceived American interference in Iran's domestic affairs, coupled with accusations of supporting opposition groups and imposing economic sanctions, has fueled a persistent distrust. Geopolitical differences, especially regarding regional conflicts and nuclear policies, continue to contribute to the complex and contentious nature of their relationship. The result is a multifaceted dynamic marked by decades of diplomatic challenges and mutual suspicion.

The US Dollar's status as the primary international currency stems from a combination of historical strength after World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement, and the United States' pivotal role in global trade and finance. Its widespread use in international transactions, deep financial markets, and the perception of stability further solidify its dominance, alongside the political and military influence of the United States, making it the preferred reserve currency and a common medium of exchange globally.

Advertisements is a time tested weapon to sell and market products, be it through print media aur digital media. Given its impact, it plays a significant role in setting an image of a product in the mind of its target audience. 
Hence it becomes imperative to keep a check on the kind of products been advertised.
Another sector that has a high influence on society is bollywood. The products advertised by them generally see an increased sale in the consumer market.
This is common knowledge but the irony is some banned products are also being endorsed by these actors under the name of surrogacy ads. Recently bollywood megastars have been criticised for endorsing tobacco products. When asked, each of them have responded carefully to save their image, but the big question is why people of such influence are being a part of this campaigning. Can they be questioned for their moral responsibility.
Another big question is how come banned products been advertised openly. Whats their business structure, how much money do they have, what support system do they have and lastly what harm is it doing to our society, lets discuss.

However, beneath the glossy filters and curated feeds lies a darker side—a world of comparison, addiction, and privacy concerns. Many users grapple with the pressure to project a flawless image, leading to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Moreover, the constant barrage of information and the algorithmic echo chambers can skew our perceptions of reality and polarize our beliefs. In this digital age, understanding the nuanced facts of social media is essential to harnessing its benefits while safeguarding our mental well-being and privacy.

Navigating the realities of social media requires a discerning eye and a critical mind. It's a place where authenticity can shine but often competes with carefully constructed personas. Users must be vigilant about the information they consume and share, as misinformation and echo chambers thrive in the digital realm. Privacy concerns demand a closer look at how our data is collected and used, prompting discussions about digital rights and online ethics. In this ever-evolving landscape, fostering a healthy relationship with social media involves striking a balance between staying connected and safeguarding our mental and emotional well-being, ultimately reminding us that the power to shape digital reality lies in our hands.

In recent times, concerns have arisen about the practices of certain segments of Indian media, revealing a pattern of subtle news suppression that has raised eyebrows among both citizens and watchdog organizations. While media is traditionally seen as a pillar of democracy, these concerns suggest a departure from its intended role. Critics argue that a combination of editorial bias, corporate influence, and political pressure has led to the selective coverage of news stories. By strategically underplaying or altogether ignoring certain stories, Indian media outlets may be inadvertently shaping public opinion and limiting citizens' access to a well-rounded understanding of critical events. As media's influence remains profound, an open discourse about news transparency and accountability has become increasingly vital in maintaining a healthy democratic society.

The implications of this alleged silent news suppression are far-reaching. With the rise of digital platforms, the speed at which information spreads has increased exponentially, making the role of media in shaping public perception more crucial than ever. By systematically sidelining certain stories, media outlets might be compromising their responsibility to inform the public objectively. As citizens become more cognizant of these dynamics, demands for greater media integrity, unbiased reporting, and ethical journalism are echoing across the nation, calling for a reevaluation of media practices and a renewed commitment to upholding the principles of a free and transparent press.

Bollywood movies, like most mainstream films worldwide, generate revenue through multiple streams. One of the primary sources of income for Bollywood movies is box office collections. When a film is released in theaters, audiences purchase tickets to watch it, and a significant portion of the ticket sales goes back to the movie's producers and distributors. Successful films can make substantial profits in this manner. Additionally, the sale of distribution rights, both domestic and international, contributes significantly to a movie's earnings. Bollywood movies are often sold to various platforms, such as streaming services, television networks, and DVD distributors, which allows the producers to monetize their content further. Apart from that, product placements and brand tie-ups serve as additional revenue streams, where companies pay to have their products or brands featured prominently within the film. Merchandising and music rights also play a role in generating income, with soundtracks and movie-related products being sold to fans and enthusiasts.

The success of Bollywood movies is not only confined to the Indian market but extends to the global audience as well. Overseas theatrical releases and international distribution contribute substantially to the box office revenue. In recent years, streaming platforms have gained immense popularity, and Bollywood movies have taken advantage of this trend. Producers strike deals with digital platforms to release their films directly on these services, reaching a vast online audience and generating revenue through subscriptions or pay-per-view models. Additionally, satellite rights, where TV networks pay for the rights to broadcast the movie, are a significant source of income. The combination of these diverse revenue streams and the ever-growing global popularity of Bollywood films has made the industry a lucrative and thriving powerhouse in the entertainment world.

Cricket is the most loved and popular sport in India. People worship cricketers, cry when they lose, celebrate in their wins. But the game has garnered attention not only for the game that it is but also for the vices committed under its name.
Betting and match fixing have been two most unfamous words associated with the game. Time and again small and big names have been found involved in these illegal practices. 
These practices have not been limited to the involvement of bookies or cricketers but enough links have been found between match fixings and underworld. 
How these bets are placed, how did police discover betting and fixing, which all famous cricketers have been guilty of in this malpractice. How betting has evolved over time, what's this nexus, let's discuss.

Tragedy struck on 2 June 2023 near Balasore, Odisha, as a devastating incident unfolded. The unfortunate event involved a collision between three trains, namely the Coromandel Express and the SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah SF Express, triggered by an initial accident involving a goods train near the Bahanaga Bazar station. The repercussions were severe, with a staggering loss of life, as several hundred individuals perished, while over a thousand others suffered injuries. In this informative video, we delve into the details of the Odisha incident, exploring its causes and shedding light on its underlying factors. Additionally, we thoroughly examine reports from the Indian Railways, including those from the IR, CAG, and CBI, aiming to uncover the systemic issues plaguing the railway network. By meticulously analyzing these reports, we strive to gain a comprehensive understanding of the root causes contributing to the railway mishaps in India. Through this reimagined narrative, we provide a fresh perspective on the tragic event, finding answers to questions like How did this incident take place? Why did this tragedy happen? What went wrong? And much more.

---------------------------------
In October 2021, Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on charges of drug possession. The arrest sparked a huge controversy, with many people believing that Khan was targeted because of his father's fame.

The NCB claimed that they had received a tip-off that a rave party was being held on a cruise ship, the Cordelia, and that drugs were being consumed. They raided the ship and arrested Khan and several others.

Khan was released on bail after spending 22 days in jail. The case is still ongoing, and it is unclear whether he will be convicted.

In recent months, there have been allegations of corruption against Sameer Wankhede, the NCB officer who led the raid on the Cordelia. Wankhede has denied the allegations, but he has been transferred to a different post.

The Cordelia cruise drug case has raised many questions about the NCB's methods and its role in targeting celebrities. It remains to be seen how the case will unfold, but it is clear that it has had a significant impact on Indian society.

Let’s discuss and try to find answers to 
Was Aryan Khan really involved in drug use?
Was the NCB's raid on the Cordelia justified?
Was Sameer Wankhede corrupt?
What does the Cordelia cruise drug case say about the NCB and its role in targeting celebrities? And much more in this video.

And why is a country that was once a significant trading route now struggling to survive? In this video, let's talk about each of these and much more.

Since the industry is in so much demand, there is an assumption that the companies must be making huge profits. But like any other business, this industry has its own set of challenges, let's discuss what these challenges are, how the airlines compete against each other to sustain huge competition, and what tricks and tactics they use to maximise their profits.

Bermuda triangle has always been about mysteries and speculations. Hundreds of planes and ships have disappeared in thin air without leaving any traces of evidence. 
Some say its a cursed area, while others believe in monsters and aliens. 
There have been thousand of theories, books, movies and articles around this topic, with different reasonings and explanations.

But how much truth has been discovered till date. Why do people claim to have faced issues with compass and electronic gears.

Is there really anything mysterious about it or its just an urban legend. Lets discuss

Football being the most loved game in the world has garnered a lot of attention in the FIFA world cup as well but not for all the right reasons.
Qatar as a host has been under the lens of various allegations such as human right exploitation, corruption, forcing tourists to follow the law of the land, and poor conditions. 
Amidst the storm of questions, the biggest question that emerged was how Qatar beat the USA in winning the hosting rights of the FIFA world cup since Qatar hardly has any recognition as a football-playing team. 
What was the reason that Qatar wanted this so desperately, and how much are they profiting from this deal. 
What are the long-term plans of Qatar with this deal? And the main question is how much truth can there be in the fact that there could have been corruption while making a selection of hosts.

Today, we will find the answers to some interesting questions like how the BCCI was formed, how it has influenced the cricket economy and stature around the world, is it controlled privately or whether is there any government influence.

Judiciary does take its own time before giving any judgements to ensure fair trials but Yasin Malik’s case is no common cause. 
Even after 32 years, judgement is pending in the cases of airforce personnel killings and kidnapping of Rubaiya Saeed.
This is despite the fact that many times Yasin has accepted his crimes on public platforms.

Few questions arise naturally like what is the reason that he was roaming free for so long, why was he entertained by political parties and top ministers, and how come he owns such huge wealth. The answers to these are not so straight and obvious.

Let's discuss!

(Coupon valid for first 250 users)

Knowing what you should do when dealing with the police is really useful. Following some simple rules will keep you out of trouble in an emergency situation. Police and our judicial system are there for ensuring justice in the society but these terms often terrify the common man. Instead of seeing these entities as a strength of the society, people often try to avoid any kind of encounter with the police or judiciary until there is no choice.
Nevertheless, oftentimes people do encounter such situations where they have to deal with the police and judicial system, hence, it becomes a necessity to have some basic knowledge and awareness about the rights which a common man has. 
Let's discuss the system and basic rights in this video.

Musk, who is known for his ventures in technology and space exploration through companies like Tesla and SpaceX, views Twitter as a crucial platform for public discourse. He has expressed intentions to enhance Twitter's capabilities for free speech while also addressing concerns related to censorship and the platform's role in public debates. Musk's acquisition of Twitter reflects his broader ambitions to influence the global conversation on technology, freedom of expression, and the future of digital communication.

Let's discuss how this whole process takes place and if there are any loopholes that can lead to EVM hacking.

“Election funds” or money, is a prerequisite for contesting elections. Running advertisements, digital campaigns, conduction of rallies and distributing free stuff, everything requires money. Let's discuss how the political parties are managing to collect these funds. We will also discuss the most debated topic of electoral bonds. Political parties swear by the good aspects of these bonds whereas the ECI and RBI are against it. 

How important is transparency, what are the loopholes in these processes, what are we compromising on. Let's discuss.

By now, most of us understand what these issues are. In this video, let's discuss how our Indian society itself has contributed in prevailing this menace of gender inequality. How since childhood, we are taught that the stature of a man is higher than a woman. How we learn that a girl is to be treated differently than a boy. We will also discuss why a man finds a woman an easy target to harm. Why a woman tolerates the abuser. Is this about women rights or human rights? Let's discuss.

Government has released the draft of National Education Policy 2020. It seems to have its own pros and cons. This video is my analysis based on some facts, history and data. I am discussing how the new draft claims to achieve 6% GDP investment in education, changes in the structure of education, shortcomings of this draft and how much of it can be expected to be implemented. Hope it will make things easier to understand.
